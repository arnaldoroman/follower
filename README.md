**follower** fetches data from social networks.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sydneystockholm/follower.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/sydneystockholm/follower)


This library is progressively obedient, i.e. it attempts to use APIs
(some that are known and others that aren't) that require the least amount of
authorisation before finally resorting to OAuth.



## Basic example

Get share counts for a URL

```javascript
var follower = require('follower');

var shares = new follower.URLShares();

shares.count('http://example.com', function (err, shares) {
    console.log(shares);
    /* { facebook_likes: 789
       , pinterest_pins: 1169
       , twitter_tweets: 143
       , google_plus_ones: 1 } */
});
```

Fetch the latest instagram media by hashtag and memoise the results

```javascript
var follower = require('follower');

//Setup a Redis connection
var cache = new follower.Cache(6379, 'localhost');

//Memoise the results for one hour
cache.setTTL(3600);

var instagram = new follower.Instagram({
    client_id: '(oauth_client_id)'
  , secret: '(oauth_secret)'
  , cache: cache
});

instagram.latestHashtagMedia('YOLO', function (err, media) {
    //...
});
```
